# sqlformat

This crate is a port of https://github.com/kufii/sql-formatter-plus
written in Rust. It is intended to be usable as a pure-Rust library
for formatting SQL queries.

There is currently no binary interface.
This crate was written for formatting queries to logs
within `sqlx`, but it may be useful to other crates
in the Rust ecosystem.
